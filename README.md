# Flypi - An open source, modular, affordable tool for imaging experiments.

### Initially developed by [Trend in Africa](www.trendinafrica.org) and published in [Plos Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002702).

 Version 1.0 was released with the paper and can be found [here](https://github.com/amchagas/Flypi/tree/v1.0.0).

#### The system can be used for optical microscopy, fluorescence, behavioural tracking, optogenetics, calcium imaging and thermogenetics.


#### Further development is being done by [Prometheus Science](wwww.prometheus-science.com)

#### Some samples imaged with the device:

## Custom PCB

You can order the PCBs and buy the parts to assemble them through the [Kitspace page](https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/prometheus-science/FlyPi).

## Necessary Libraries:

LED Ring from Adafruit:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel

LED Matrix from Adafruit:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library


gpac library:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gpac

libav library:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libav-tools


update pyserial library:
sudo pip3 install --upgrade serial


## *.h264 conversion to *.avi:

is done via avconv (which is installed with libav-tools).
